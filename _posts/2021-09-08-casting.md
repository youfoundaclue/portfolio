"Casting Out" is a documentary made as a graduation project by a group of students from the University of Westminster. It was directed by Louis Eddy.

The project was first shown at the University's graduation event, to a very positive reception. 
Commissioned privately, the film's score was composed by Skye Stephenson and features inspiration from artists such as Haruomi Hosono, Brian Eno and Daniel Lopatin.
